We all hopped on a zoom call and worked on the wireframes and the implementation of the website together. Everyone one took turns being the “driver” when coding. For
the wireframes, we all drew what we think the website should look like before and during the zoom call we decided what would look best. Since we all did it together at
the same time, we found it fair to say that everyone contributed the same amount.
