GameCon is a free, social networking site that caters to gamers, who are one of the largest groups of a specific interest in the world. 
The purpose of this application is to foster an environment built primarily to unite gamers through multiple forms of media. In terms of format, 
it is akin to a website like Reddit. Similar to the way in which reddit is able to filter posts to show you what you want, GameCon is able to filter 
posts based on the games of your interest.

Our platform would have functions that enable users to interact with posts.  This would include  liking, disliking, commenting, sharing and filtering  
posts by tags that they are interested in. These posts would be sorted by their recency. Users can also create accounts, login, and send direct messages 
to other users.
