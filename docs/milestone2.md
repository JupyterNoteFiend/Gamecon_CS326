Our UI consists of 5 screens. The first being the main screen, with 4 other screens with different functionalities attached. The banner at the top has links that lead to these 4 screens. It also contains a search bar which is not yet functional.  The first 3 screens are used for account management. As their labels suggest, they allow the user to create an account, login, delete an account. The final screen is used to create new posts. You provide your username, the content, and a hyperlink for adding an image to your post.  Once you post, you will be directed back to the main screen where you will see your post.
